Demo Analytic Data Platform (ADP)

This project implements a comprehensive metadata model, featuring a basic front-end application for entering metadata related to datasets, attributes, data quality controls, and requirements. It is SQL-oriented, determining data lineage during deployment and executing data transformations using incremental loading. While it does not include an orchestration tool like Azure Data Factory, the metadata model provides sufficient information to create generic ingestion pipelines in any tool.
